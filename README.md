# Pathfinder_-_Maze_Generator
Pathfinder using a* or Dijkstra's algorithm and maze generator


This python program allows you to place a start and end point on a plane and deploy your choice of either Dijkstra's algorithm or a* pthfinding algorithm using the euclidean distance to navigate from start to end.


You can also erase and replace the points, draw obstacles or auto-generate a random maze which uses a backtracking algorithm.
